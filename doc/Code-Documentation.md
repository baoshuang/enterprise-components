## Documenting your q code

### Available tags

- /L/ <strong>L</strong>icense
- /S/ <strong>S</strong>cript summary
- /T/ Script star<strong>t</strong>-up command
- /A/ <strong>A</strong>uthor
- /D/ <strong>D</strong>ate
- /V/ <strong>V</strong>ersion
- /G/ <strong>G</strong>lobal
- /F/ <strong>F</strong>unction
- /P/ <strong>P</strong>arameter
- /R/ <strong>R</strong>eturn value
- /E/ <strong>E</strong>xample

**Note:**

As opposed to other available systems, each line has to contain a tag. For example, this will work:

```
/F/ Description of the function
/F/ Some other stuff about this function
```

and both lines  will be include in the documentation, whereas this:

```
/F/ Description of the function
// Some other stuff about this function
```

will only include the first line in the output documentation file.

#### License

Provides a license information. Each tag will be shown in html file in separate line and included in the "License" section. 

**Example:**

```

#### Script summary

Brief description of the script. Each tag will be shown in the html file in separate line and included in the "About" section. 

**Example:**

```
/S/ sampleFile.q
/S/ This is a brief description of the functionality
```

#### Script start-up command

Command used to start up the script. Each tag will be shown in the html file in separate line.

**Example:**

```
/T/ q sampleFile.q
/T/ q sampleFile.q -p 5001
```

#### Author

Script author(s). Each tag will be shown in html file in separate line and included in the "About" section. 

**Example:**

```
/A/ Author1 Name a1.name@email.com
/A/ Author2 Name a2.name@email.com
```

#### Date

Creation date. Single tag included in the "About" section. 

**Example:**

```
/D/ 2011.11.17
```

#### Version
Script version. Single tag included in the "About" section. 

**Example:**

```
/V/ 1.0
```

#### Global

Global can be considered as any variable defined outside of the function body. This tag allows to provide a brief description of the global. Tags will be merged to show a single message in the output. Applies to variables without namespace as  well as to private and non-private variables.

**Examples:**

```
/G/ this is a typical global
myGlobal:100;

/G/ this is a namespace based global
.ns.var:`no;

/G/ this is a private,
/G/ namespace based global
.ns.p.var:`yes;
```

#### Function

Brief description of the function. Tags will be merged to show a single message in the output. Applies to global, private and non-private functions.

**Examples:**

```
/F/ Fully global function
init:{[] 
  :2+2;
  };

/F/ Non-private, namespace based function
.ns.init:{[] 
  :2+2;
  };

/F/ Private, namespace based function
.ns.p.func:{[] 
  :2+2;
  };

/F/ Private, namespace based function
/F/ Equivalent to previous function
.ns.p.func:{[] :2+2}
```

**Note:**

Please note that 'private' functions will not be included in the generated documentation. More details about 'private' functions can be found [here](../Exxeleron-q-coding-conventions#private-variables-and-functions).

#### Parameter

Each function parameter can be described in detail using this tag. The general pattern for each `/P/` tag looks as follows:

```
/P/ paramName - description
```

Optionally, paramName can contain type of the parameter:

```
/P/ paramName:dataType - description
```

**Example:**

```
/F/ This function takes two parameters and adds them
/P/ a - some number
/P/ b:int - some other number of type int
.ns.addAandB:{[a;b]
  :a+b;
  };
```

#### Return value
Indicates functionâ€™s return value.

**Example:**

```
/F/ Function that multiplies two numbers
/P/ first:int - this is a number
/P/ second:int - this is another number of type int
/R/ int - result of multiplication of two input numbers
.ns.multiply:{[first;second]
  :a*b;
  };
```

#### Example

Shows sample call related to function definition. Each tag will be shown in html file in separate line and included in the "About" section. 

**Example:**

```
/F/ This function takes three parameters and does nothing
/P/ a - first parameter 
/P/ b - second parameter
/P/ c - third parameter
/E/ .ns.doNothing[1;2;3]
/E/ .ns.doNothing[`sym;1f;()]
.ns.doNothing{[a;b;c]
  };
```
